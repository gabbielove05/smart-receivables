ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Your API key was exposed in a public repository and disabled by OpenRouter.

To fix this:

1. Go to https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. DELETE the old key (the one that was exposed)
5. CREATE a new API key
6. Copy the new key and share it with me

IMPORTANT: Do NOT share the new key in any public repository or chat that might be logged.
Only share it directly with me for testing, then we'll set it up securely in Streamlit Cloud.

The new key should start with: sk-or-v1-
